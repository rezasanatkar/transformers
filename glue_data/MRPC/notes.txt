this dataset is about binary classification task whether two sentences are paraphrase of each other or not.

it seems that MRPC is relatively a small dataset where train.tsv (trainig dataset) only has about 4k pair of positive examples of paraphrasing,
test.tsv (test dataset) has 1.6k sentence paris and dev.tsv has .4k examples.

it seems that msr_paraphrase_test.txt is a post-processed cleaned version of test.tsv and similarly msr_paraphrase_train.txt is a post-processed cleaned
version of train.tsv
